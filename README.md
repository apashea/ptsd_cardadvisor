This repository stores code and documentation related to the hierarchical POMDP Active Inference agent model prepared for in silico experimentation in a behavioral task over a chosen number of trials. This model seeks to model identifiable behaviors and patterns found in clinical PTSD, in relationship to both qualitative studies and previous simulations, in the direction of gaining insights for treatment interventions.
