This repository stores code and documentation related to the hierarchical POMDP Active Inference agent model prepared for in silico experimentation in a behavioral card advisor task over a chosen number of trials. This model seeks to model identifiable behaviors and patterns found in clinical PTSD, in relationship to both qualitative studies and previous simulations, with an emphasis upon the social aspects of PTSD which have been lesser emphasized in previous simulation literature. The overall project, rooted in computational psychiatry, psychology, and phenomenological research, is developed in the direction of gaining nuanced insights for informing and enhancing treatment interventions.
